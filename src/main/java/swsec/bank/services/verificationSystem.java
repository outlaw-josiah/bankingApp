 * Created by cseaman on 3/8/2016.
 * This class simulates a physical system (e.g. an ATM or a teller) that can physically verify
 * that money has changed hands. In a real scenario, the verification system would communicate with the
 * rest of the application over a network, but here we are simulating it with a simple method call.
